    Read in CSV to my notebook (location analysis), joined both into 1 dataframe, plotted lat/long into a heatmap

8-20:
    Scrapped heatmap after showing group because it looked like a big blob, worked together to figure out plotting the locations on a map.
    Decided to break down/map data using certain crimes to make the maps easier to read. Looked at plotly and decided to use it for overall mapping.
