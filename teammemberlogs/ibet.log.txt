Ibet’s Project 1 Log 8/15: I was adopted by my group. We discussed our topic (Crime in the time of COVID), assigned tasks to each member  and set up notebooks as well as started to learn how to make our own branches in gibhub. 8/18: We took the data Rick cleaned up and started studying it together. 8/19: Took the 2019 and 2020 csv files Rick uploaded to the master to start my individual research. Read these into my notebook focusing on the “Overall Crime”, and began to pull comparisons for different categories of crime (2019 vs 2010). 8/20: Began plotting the comparisons I found different or interesting from the comparisons I had done the previous day. Created 4 bar plots. 8/21: Discussed my project with my tutor. He helped me with some matplolib/plotting formatting and other issues. Started to organize data in order to plot the overall change per month.8/22: Wrote code for the overall crime change in order to plot a line graph and bar graph depicting total number of crimes by month 2019 vs 2020. 8/23: De bugged overall crime graphs as well as line charts that were not displaying the correct data. 8/24: Cleaned up code as well as all bar and line charts, made sure all png files were displaying properly and made my slides for the presentation.
