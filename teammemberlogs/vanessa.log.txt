Vanessa's Project 1 Log

8-13:
    Began project 1- Identified what we wanted to research and found data

8-15:
    Assigned tasks within our group, set up notebooks, set up github

8-18: 
    Read in CSV to master branch, studied data together

8-19:
    Read in CSV to my notebook (location analysis), joined both into 1 dataframe, plotted lat/long into a heatmap

8-20:
    Scrapped heatmap after showing group because it looked like a big blob, worked together to figure out plotting the locations on a map.
    Decided to break down/map data using certain crimes to make the maps easier to read. Looked at plotly and decided to use it for overall mapping.

8-22: 
    Worked on plotting with plotly using chorpleth

8-23:
    Scrapped choropleth after realizing it was the wrong type of map to use. Worked on mapbox for about 4 hours, was able to get the legend and hover function to work, but couldn't get map to show.

8-24:
    Worked on mapbox with Omar and was able to get maps to show! Yay! Also plotted murders, theft, assaults, and DWI location data using mapbox.
